# Escape from Hyper Island
----------------------
###Hyper Island - Exploring Code Module - Brief

Duration: 4 weeks

Challange was to individually create a game/experience for the web, in the theme decided by our team. 
My team's chosen theme was "Dreams", which allowed us to let our own individual interpretation of dreams guide our work.

It was my first introduction to WebGL technologies, along with concepts like camera and light positioning in 3D spaces, nav meshes, as well as physics system. 

##Technologies used:
A-Frame, Three.js, Javascript, HTML5
